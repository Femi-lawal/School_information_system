# School_information_system

This app was built as the final project for Andela Learning Community 2
It is completely unimpressive and hopefully I'll improve upon it eventually

## How To Run
- Preferably use a version of Node 8.X
- In commandline type "npm install" to install necessary dependencies
- In commandline type "node app"
- Visit localhost:3001 in your browser
